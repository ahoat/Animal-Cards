# Animal-Cards

## Animal card matching game

Initially put together to practice CSS grids.  Now want to try and turn this into a matching card game.

### Things to add

- [] Create style for the back of the cards
- [] Make cards rotate 180deg on click
- [] Cards to be loaded face down
- [] Figure out how to shuffle the card order on load/refresh
- [] When 2 cards are matched, they stay face up
[] Reset button to restart the game
